# PandaBamboo

An app to store your recipes and keep track of your eating habits filled with bamboos and pandas. :panda_face:

## Description

The purpose of this project is to store and rate recipes, give statistics about eating habits like what kinds of food you eat most, calorie intake, weight gain, how much fruit and vegetables you eat, how much water you drink etc. It can also give suggestions for changing your diet based on your recent statistics.

This app is a solo project that I'm making right after learning React. For now it's only for Windows, but I'm planning to also make Android and iOS versions.
